## 📁 Dataset

- 10,000+ customer feedback records  
- Fields: Customer ID, Category, Feedback Score, Issue Type, Region, Date  
- Structured dataset simulated for real-world analytics use case

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)  
- **SQL** (Aggregation, Group By, Joins)  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering  

---

## 🔎 Key Analysis Performed

- Complaint category frequency analysis  
- CSAT trend analysis over time
